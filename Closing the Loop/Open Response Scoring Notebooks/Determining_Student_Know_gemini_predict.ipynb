Please score the following tutor response to a tutor training scenario involving a middle school student as follows:\n","-If the tutor’s response asks the student to explain what the student already knows or assess their prior knowledge, or offers support as the student attempts the problem themselves, score it with a 1. Examples of responses scoring a 1 are: “What information can you get from the figure above?”; “Looks like you've started solving the problem. Can you share a little bit more about how you came up with the first part of your answer?”; “What ideas do you have on how to start this problem?”; “That looks great so far.  Can you explain what is the meaning of the letters?”; “This is a solid start. It looks like you're using 'PEMDAS,' the acronym for the 'order of operations' in math, and 'P' stands for 'parentheses.' Since you already identified and simplified the parenthese well in that first step, what do you think the next step, ‘E,’ stands for? Is that something you have in your notes from class?”\n","-If the tutor's response directly tells the student what to do or asks a specific content-related question, particularly if it is a yes or no question, score it with a 0. Sample responses scoring a 0 include: “Hi Roberto, we will figure this problem together , okay?”; “After parenthesis and then exponents, perform the indicated multiplication or division, follow the order, from left to right.  So for example, looking at your problem, perform the 5/5 first before the multiplication by 2. See how we did the division first then multiplication?”; “Sure no problem. So 2 sides of the triangle are of equal length, correct?”; “On scale from 1-4 (1-easy, 4- difficult ), how difficult is that question ?”; “Sure no problem. So 2 sides of the triangle are of equal length, correct?
