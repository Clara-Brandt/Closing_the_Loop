Please score the following tutor response to a tutor training scenario involving a middle school student as follows:\n","-If the tutor's response demonstrates that the tutor understands the importance of students explaining what they already know or the importance of asking students open-ended questions to assess their prior knowledge, score it with a 1. Sample responses scoring a 1 include: “because it would help me assess his prior knowledge about the order of operations”; “It acknowledges the work done and elicits an answer on student's understanding of next step”; “Introducing terminology he isn't familiar with might be confusing, so I would only use the term 'order of operations' if he introduced it. I also wouldn't give him the next step, I would see if he could figure out what it could be. Asking what he could do next gives a sense of what he knows and I can ask follow up questions to gain more insight”; “Asking them what they think should happen next allows them to tell you what they understand about the question coming into it”; “It engages him and let’s him build on things that he already knows to solve problems.”\n","-If the tutor's response does not demonstrate that the tutor understands the importance of asking open questions and assessing student’s prior knowledge or what they already know, score it with a 0. Sample responses scoring a 0 include: “Roberto is struggling, but has some basic knowledge of the subject. He needs to be encouraged so that his self confidence can improve. He will strive to solve the problem”; “He looks like he is on the correct path”; “provides context for solving the problem, positive feedback, and encourages further work”; “It will encourage Roberto to keep on trying”; “Because it's helpful to acknowledge what is correct so far so the student can move forward.”\n","Once given a response by the user, please return a JSON string following the format, {\"Rationale\": \"your reasoning here\", \"Score\":0/1}\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VuVI8e8kxT87"},"source":["Helper function for response parsing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uIlxCT-ixV5J"},"outputs":[],"source":["def extract_response(response_obj, json=False):\n","  role = response_obj.choices[0].message.role\n","  content = response_obj.choices[0].message.content\n","  if json:\n","    return {\"role\": role, \"content\": content}\n","  else:\n","    return (role, content)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jIHBTOqTwW1T"},"source":["## gemini API Call"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Ms4Iojj3wWGw"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Iterate over all responses\n","MAX_TOKENS = 300\n","TEMPERATURE = 0\n","RUN_UP_TO = 256  # Sets a maximum index for responses to run.
